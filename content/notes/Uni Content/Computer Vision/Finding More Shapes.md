An edge point in the image corresponds to a circle in the accumulator space. Every point on the circle in the accumulator space is considered a vote

Same process as line voting

The accumulator space is actually third dimensional, the third dimension represents the radius of the circle

The point in the accumulator with the most votes will be an intersection of the cones where the circles have the same radius as they did in the original image, and the point will be the crossing of all of the circles

So we are actually generating cones of votes

## Extensions into Conic Sections
### Ellipse
$$\frac{(x-x_0)^2}{a^2}+\frac{(y-y_0)^2}{b^2}=1$$
Ellipses are described by 4 parameters

Accumulator size increases rapidly as the range of values increases

Memory size becomes impractical

Motivates approaches to save memory and improve speed
## Improving Circular Hough Transform Performance

Differentiating (x-x_0)^2+(y-y_0)^2=r^2 

Gives $\frac{dy}{dx}=-\frac{(x-x_0)}{(y-y_0)}$

The final circle equation only has two parameters, which reduces accumulator space greatly, increasing performance 

Rearranging
$$y-y_0=\frac{r}{\sqrt{1+(\frac{dy}{dx})^2}}$$
$(\frac{dy}{dx})^2$ is the edge direction 

Substituting for (x-x_0) back into the circle equation
$$(\frac{dy}{dx})^2(y-y_0)^2+(y-y_0)^2=r^2$$
## Arbitrary Shapes

How to recognise shapes which are sections

Use a generalised Hough transform

And vote via the look-up table

Form a discrete look-up table (R-table)
## R-table Construction

Then store those combinations of r and \alpha and index them by the edge direction

Then measure the edge direction at the points on the outside of the shape

Firstly find the reference (centre) point of the shape, which can be found by averaging the x and y points of the shape

Edge direction is not unique so there will be multiple entries in the tables at certain values
- This eventually gives noise in the accumulator where multiple values are stored at the same index

Using this, we then determine the length r and direction \alpha to the outside points from the reference point
## Procedure for Generalised Hough Transform
### Preparation

Form r-table (list of points, indexed by edge direction)

Determine centre of template shape
### Application

Use r-table to vote for points in the real image

Take maximum from accumulator to find centre co-ordinates of the shape

## Scaling for Generalised Hough Transform

Accounting for shapes being different distances from the camera

If you want to find a shape regardless of the scale of the shape (any size)
- We then have an accumulator in terms of x_0, y_0, centre coordinates and the scale
- We scale the vector of the voting, we vote for scales of the distance from the point to the centre
- This gives a three dimensional accumulator array, which will find shapes whatever size they appear
## Orientation for Generalised Hough Transform

Add another dimension to the accumulator space

We can then rotate the vector in the r table, and then vote for different rotations 
## Active Contours

For unknown arbitrary shapes
- Extract by evolution

Shape is placed on image and contracts until it finds the desired shape
